# JavaScript Devel Starter Kit

This starter kit aims to be a bare bone starting point for building a monolithic NodeJS App, with separated backend APIs and a rich web user interface...

## Why build a monolith?

These days every one is building microservices, for a new business it may be too overwelming specially if you code and do business all by your self.. Eventhough we are a monolith, our code is separated between backend and web ui, enabling easy scale once you get funded..

## What's in the Box

1. Bare bone JavaScript project structure 
1. Linting based on AirBnB rules
1. Routes nicely structured as controllers
1. Views
1. Integrated Swagger API
1. Secured access to Swagger API
1. Basic tests script
1. NPM scripts to get started
